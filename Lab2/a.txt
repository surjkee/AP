Beside the hut the cherries are in bloom , 
And May bugs o'er them dance The peasants from 
The fields return with weary seep 'Tis late 
The young maids as they go sing songs At home 
The tables have been laid, and supper waits . 
A family at table sit without 
Dusk slowly comes , the evening stars are out . 
The daughter serves , but seems to take too long ; 
The mother is impatient and about 
To scold, when lo ! - a bird bursts into song . 
The darkness cloaks the heavens overhead ... 
Beside the hut her little ones to bed 
The mother puts , and then , afraid that they'll 
Not sleep , lies down nearby 
The world seems dead 
All's still save for the maids and nightingale .

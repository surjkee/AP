and may bugs o'er them dance the peasants from 
the young maids as they go sing songs at home 
a family at table sit without 
the daughter serves , but seems to take too long ; 
to scold, when lo ! - a bird bursts into song . 
beside the hut her little ones to bed 
not sleep , lies down nearby 
all's still save for the maids and nightingale .

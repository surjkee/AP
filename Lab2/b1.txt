BESIDE THE HUT THE CHERRIES ARE IN BLOOM , 
THE FIELDS RETURN WITH WEARY SEEP 'TIS LATE 
THE TABLES HAVE BEEN LAID, AND SUPPER WAITS . 
DUSK SLOWLY COMES , THE EVENING STARS ARE OUT . 
THE MOTHER IS IMPATIENT AND ABOUT 
THE DARKNESS CLOAKS THE HEAVENS OVERHEAD ... 
THE MOTHER PUTS , AND THEN , AFRAID THAT THEY'LL 
THE WORLD SEEMS DEAD
